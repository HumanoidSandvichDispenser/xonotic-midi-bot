# Xonotic MIDI Bot

This is an unfinished script that converts a MIDI file into a config file that
executes bot commands to play music.

Also playback plays an octave down because the notemaps were inputted
incorrectly which will be fixed soon.

## Usage

```
./midi-bot-orchestra.py FILENAME [DELAY]
```

`-p N` --- transposes by N semitones

`-h` --- includes a header containing the aliases for bots to play notes
